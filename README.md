# NCCU Quantum Hackathon (QC-CNN)
## Model: QC-CNN

## Introduction
Welcome to the Quantum-Classical CNN Hybrid Model! This QCCNN model is splitted into two parts as below.

## The Quantum filter Overview
With four qubits, we start our Quantum filter(Quanv2d). First,  
The QC Hybrid Model employs quantum circuits and algorithms for particular phases of computation, particularly in areas like optimization, machine learning, and data analysis. It then combines these results with classical computing techniques for more comprehensive data processing, analysis, and storage.

### Key Features:
- **Quantum Acceleration**: 
- **Hybrid Integration**: Seamlessly integrates quantum computations with classical processes.
- **Scalability**: Adapts to different scales of data and computational requirements.
- **Versatility**: Suitable for a wide range of applications, including complex simulations, machine learning, and data encryption.

### Hardware Requirements:
