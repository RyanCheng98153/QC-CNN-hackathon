# NCCU Quantum Hackathon (QC-CNN)

## Introduction
Welcome to the Quantum-Classical CNN Hybrid Model! This QCCNN model is splitted into two parts as below.

## The CNN Overview
With four qubits, we start our Quantum filter(Quanv2d). First, we use **angle encoding(RZ, RY)** to transform data into quantum state. And then we use **one-to-one stabilizer** to reduce the error flip bits,

### Key Features:
- **Quantum Acceleration**: 
- **Hybrid Integration**: Seamlessly integrates quantum computations with classical processes.

### Hardware Requirements:
  - Colab with T4 GPU
### Package Requirements:
  - sklearn
  - torch
  - pennylane
  - os
